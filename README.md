# pdftotext

This repository is based on poppler 0.22.5 and includes only the pdftotext.cc
file and a sample of output HTML generated by running it on a PDF.

## Changes

Adds a new option, -bbox-layout, which is very similar to -bbox, but instead of
only producing word coordinates, it also produces tags for flows, blocks,
lines, and words.  The blocks, lines, and words all include coordinates.  This
output is useful for producing [ALTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_%28XML%29)-like
XML for ingesting PDFs into our [Historic Oregon Newspapers](http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/)
system.

## Licensing

The license is GPL v2, as specified in the version of code this is based on,
and can be viewed in the source file, [pdftotext.cc](pdftotext.cc).
